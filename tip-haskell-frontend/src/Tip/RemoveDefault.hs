    Annoyances with the Default branch:

        * Functions that should be equal are not, such as f and g here:

            f x = case x of
                True -> e
                _    -> e'

            g x = case x of
                True  -> e
                False -> e'

        * GHC Core likes to recase on a variable that is already known, such as here:

            h x = case x of
                True -> True
                _ -> case x of
                    False -> False
                    _ -> undefined

          The call to undefined can never be reached here. Such cases should be
          removed. It also lead to a problem in the contracts checker:

          The last branch to BAD will never happen, but the alternative
          was translated to:

             ! [X] : ((X != True & X != False & X != UNR & X != BAD) => h(X) = BAD)

          I.e. for some untyped point *, we get h(*) = BAD, which is bad
          because now the true contract h ::: CF --> CF is satisfiable.
          Disaster!

          By unrolling all constructors, we get this:

              f = \ x -> case x of
                  True -> True
                  False -> case x of
                      False -> False
                      True -> BAD

          Now, x can be inlined by known-case.

    We need to do this in a m monad to put some variables in the
    bound fields of alternatives.

    TODO: We currently look at some data constructor's type constructor,
    which means we can get a problem if we have

        case e of { _ -> e' },

    we could check the type of e instead. If it is a type constructor
    with data constructors, we could unroll it.
